A look into the projects that I have completed as a data analyst

# Project 1 : [COVID-19 Exploration Project] (https://github.com/MichaelR98/Covid-Portfolio-Project)
## Using data found at [OurWorldInData.com](https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths)
### The Purpose of my SQL Queries
* Use a JOIN to explore global data.
* Explore the infection rate, total cases and total deaths grouped by countries and continents.
* Create a new column called RollingPeopleVaccinated that is an increasing sum that represents the total number of people vaccinated up to that day.
* In order to create this new column a CTE or Temp Tabled needed to be made.
* Finally I created a view in order to store the table for later visualizations.
