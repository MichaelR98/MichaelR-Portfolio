A look into the projects that I have completed as a data analyst

# Project 1 : [COVID-19 Exploration Project](https://github.com/MichaelR98/Covid-Portfolio-Project)
## Using data found at [OurWorldInData.com](https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths)
### The Purpose of my SQL Queries
* Use a JOIN to explore global data.
* Explore the infection rate, total cases and total deaths grouped by countries or continents.
* Create a new column called RollingPeopleVaccinated that is an increasing sum that represents the total number of people vaccinated up to that day.
* In order to create this new column a CTE or Temp Tabled is needed.
* Finally I created a view in order to store the table for later visualizations.



# Project 2 : [Hotel Dashboard](https://github.com/MichaelR98/Hotel-Project)
* Using a database on hotels that I found I wanted to look into PowerBi and see if it was more intuitive for me that Tableau

## Goals of the Dashboard
* Find out if the revenue of the hotels were growing by year. 
* Filter these trends by hotel type, countries and year.
* Provide a simple header that shows basic live info such as Total Revenue and ADR (average daily rate).
* Give the audience multiple different types of visualizations that explore different parts of the same data.
* Find out if more guests are bringing their own vehicles, creating a need for more parking spaces.
